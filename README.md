# SMS Spam Classification using NLTK

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between spam and ham SMS messages. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Python and NLTK, the model achieves an impressive 98.03% accuracy.

## Key Features
- Advanced data preprocessing including text cleaning and TF-IDF feature extraction.
- In-depth exploratory data analysis to understand message characteristics.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing the Naive Bayes model.
- Detailed performance evaluation using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
